<h2> Saving ALL brushes with bundles </h2>
(author note: I know you can create a bundle including your Workspace and Palettes, but somehow this method didn't worked for me)

At menu: Settings > Manage resources, click in "Create New Bundle"

Select the desired brush to backup in the column "Available" and click in the button with > signal, so the desired brush will appear in the Selected column.

Repeat this process to all brushes you want to back up, and also for other options in "Type".

(author note: you can save all brushes you costomized from Krita's defaul brush presets by choosing "Brush Presets" in Type selector).

After all items delected, click in save.
